# NaiveBayes

Naive Bayes is a popularly used Machine Learning Algorithm which is used in classification purposes.

Types:

* Gaussian NB

* Bernoulli or Binomial ( Binomial classification, 0 or 1 lables or yes no types)

* Multinomial NB


The gaussian is most likely used.

Approach

* First separate the data set into training and test data by specifying the feature vectors or column names otherwise.

* Fit using the Gaussian NB

* Get the Accuracy score

Try tweaking the parameters to get the most out of the classifier.
